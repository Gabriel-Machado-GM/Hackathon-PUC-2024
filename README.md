# Categorization of Theses and Articles from PUC

## Overview
This project aims to categorize theses and articles developed in recent years by PUC to analyze their adherence to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The project was developed to understand how PUC's academic production aligns with the global challenges proposed by the UN.

## Project Objectives
- **Categorization of Academic Content**: Identify and classify theses and articles according to the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
- **Adherence Analysis**: Evaluate the alignment level of academic works with the SDGs, providing insights into areas of greater and lesser focus within the university.
- **Results Report**: Generate a detailed report showing the distribution of academic works in relation to the SDGs.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Theses and articles published by PUC in recent years were collected and filtered.
2. **Manual and Automatic Categorization**: Application of categorization techniques, combining manual and automated methods, to classify the works according to the relevant SDGs.
3. **Quantitative Analysis**: Analysis of the distribution of works by SDGs, identifying trends and gaps in PUC's academic production.
4. **Results Validation**: Review and validation of results to ensure the accuracy of the categorization.

## Results
- The project achieved **2nd place** in an internal competition, standing out for the precision and relevance of the analysis performed.
- The results showed that most academic works are concentrated in areas such as **Quality Education (SDG 4)** and **Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3)**, with less focus on **Life Below Water (SDG 14)** and **Life on Land (SDG 15)**.

## Conclusions
This project provided valuable insight into how PUC is contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The analysis revealed both the areas of greatest impact and those that could be further explored in future academic research.
